I am "Romi Chandra". I create for creation's sake.
Since you're here, let's connect to progress the "sequence of life" with another "prime" number.

Before connecting, you should know something about "me", "perception" and "opposites".
You perceive a "Blue" bottle to be blue, albeit the bottle actually comprises of ever colour but "not Blue".
Similarly, I define myself not by the things I can do, but by the things I "can't". 

I could waste your time elaborating my strengths and weaknesses, but ultimately, my interests and skills
are as temporary as every language I know
and as fickle as every tool I use.
As "temporary" as things
that will be "useless" in the coming future.
As "fickle" as things
that can be learned by "anyone".

I am still incomplete or to say "I am progressing". 
I become a "better" version of myself with every published release of "time".
I never "forget" my past and always have a "vision" for the Future. 
I hold on to my methods "loosely",
embrace "flexibility" and "modularity",
am willing to "learn",
expect to be "wrong",
and am "confident" when Iâ€™m right.

If you think I am nothing like you, We would make a great "team". I have linked some of my social and professional profiles, feel free to share any thoughts that desire to "exist" in reality or not. I do "judge", but I also "accept".
